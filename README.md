# Student Performance Prediction

This Machine Learning project predicts student exam scores based on **Study Hours**, **Attendance**, and **Previous Scores** using **Linear Regression**.

##  Project Overview
- Built from scratch in Python using Google Colab.
- Created a custom dataset of 40+ student records.
- Explored relationships between study habits and performance.
- Trained and evaluated a Linear Regression model.

##  Features
- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
- Model Training & Evaluation (MSE, R²)  
- Visualization: Actual vs Predicted Scores  

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  

##  Results
The model accurately predicts final scores based on study hours and attendance, showing strong correlation between effort and performance.
